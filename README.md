# Computer Vision for FOD<br>

Leveraging computer vision to aid in foreign object detection in a manufacturing setting.<br>

Currently in development. Limited to no functionality.<br>

This is a research project under Professor Nathaniel Hartman at Purdue University. It is meant to be kept private. **DO NOT SHARE WITH ANYONE** who is not also working with/for Professor Hartman.<br>

Before beginning to work on this project, it is important to be familiar with git. A brief git tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/JLZ22/Git-Tutorial-for-New-Users).<br>

It is also strongly recommended that you work in a python virtual environment. One option is to use [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) and its [virtual environment manager](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) while another is python3's built in [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).


## Package List<br>

The packages you need to run scripts in `Computer-Vision-For-FOD/src` will be found here. Other directories' `src` folders may require different packages that will be covered in their respective READMEs.<br>
