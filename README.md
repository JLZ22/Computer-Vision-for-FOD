# Computer Vision for FOD<br>

Leveraging computer vision to aid in foreign object detection in a manufacturing setting.<br>

Currently in development. Limited to no functionality.<br>

This is a research project under Professor Nathaniel Hartman at Purdue University. It is meant to be kept private. **DO NOT SHARE WITH ANYONE** who is not also working with/for Professor Hartman.<br>

Before beginning to work on this project, it is important to be familiar with git. A brief git tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/JLZ22/Git-Tutorial-for-New-Users).<br>

It is also **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED** that you work in a python virtual environment. One option is to use python3's built in [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) while another is to use [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) and its [virtual environment manager](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). I (John Zeng, B.S. AI + Computer Science at Purdue, 2026) recommend using python3's built in venv because it is more lightweight than conda. **When using virtual environments, be sure to include those in the `.gitignore`. You can read more about them in the git tutorial above.**<br>
