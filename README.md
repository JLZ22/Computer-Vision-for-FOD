# Computer Vision for FOD<br>

Leveraging computer vision to aid in foreign object detection in a manufacturing setting.<br>

Currently in development. <br>

This is a research project under Professor Nathaniel Hartman at Purdue University. It is meant to be kept private. **DO NOT SHARE WITH ANYONE** who is not also working with/for Professor Hartman unless given the go-ahead from Professor Hartman.<br>

Before beginning to work on this project, it is important to be familiar with git. A brief git tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/JLZ22/Git-Tutorial-for-New-Users).<br>

It is also **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED** that you work in a python virtual environment. One option is to use python3's built in [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) while another is to use [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) and its [virtual environment manager](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). I (John Zeng, B.S. AI + Computer Science at Purdue, 2026) recommend using python3's built in venv because it is more lightweight than conda. **When using virtual environments, be sure to include those in the `.gitignore`. You can read more about them in the git tutorial above.**<br>

## Package List<br>

The packages you need to run scripts in `Computer-Vision-For-FOD` repository will be found here.<br>

tqdm
matplotlib
```

## Augmentation Notes<br>

Images were subject to the following augmentations in random order for training. 
- vertical/horizontal flips
- random crops between 0% and 10% of the image
- Gaussian Blur (applied 50% of the time)
- strengthenning or weakenning contrast between 75% and 150% the original value
- Gaussian Noise (applied 50% of the time)
- randomly adjust brightness between 80% and 120% the original value for 20% of images
- Randomly zoomed, or translated

After augmentation, for each image in the dataset, the mean pixel value per channel is subtracted from it according to the 7th source in the literature review section.

## Status

### Current Functionality

- Capable of performing image augmentation on jpg/xml pairs
- Can run the default YOLOv8 model which was trained on the COCO dataset. 

### Issues

- img augmentation with multiprocessing runs into errors with excessive memory consumption

### Todo

- find solution to memory issue
- finish augmenting rest of the classes
- resize images and corresponding bounding boxes
- transform labels from PascalVOC to YOLO 
- rename data points for final dataset
- train
