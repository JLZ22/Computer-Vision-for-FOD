# Computer Vision for FOD<br>

Leveraging computer vision to aid in foreign object detection in a manufacturing setting.<br>

Currently in development. Limited to no functionality.<br>

This is a research project under Professor Nathaniel Hartman at Purdue University. It is meant to be kept private. **DO NOT SHARE WITH ANYONE** who is not also working with/for Professor Hartman.<br>
